# DAO-The-Blockchain-Academy

The DAO-The-Blockchain-Academy is an experiment that wants to determine if Github is adequat for the collective global management of a DAO. Members of the DAO are invited to familiarize themselves with Github and how to use it within the context of collaborative and collective management of a DAO (the beginner's guide here is a good start: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

The objective of the DAO consists in uniting Blockchain educational institutions from around the globe in order to create synergies that allows all participating parties to be at the cutting edge of Blockchain education.

Parties interested in joining this experiment are invited to get in touch with admin@the-blockchain-academy.com.

This project is in the first ideation stage and invites participants to contribute to the project from the very beginning. Any proposition to give form to this project is welcome and encouraged!

Looking forward to get this DAO experiment going on a collectively managed DAO basis.
