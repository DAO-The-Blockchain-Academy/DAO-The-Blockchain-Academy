# DAO-The-Blockchain-Academy

This DAO-The-Blockchain-Academy is a experiment that wants to determine if Githubc can serve efficiently and adequatly for the collective decentralised global management of a DAO. 

The objective of the DAO consists in uniting Blockchain educational institutions from around the globe in order to create synergies that allows all participating parties to be at the cutting edge of Blockchain education.

This project is in the first ideation stage and invites participants to contribute to the project from the very beginning. Any proposition to give form to this project is welcome and encouraged!

Parties interested in joining this experiment are invited to get in touch with admin@the-blockchain-academy.com (note: we should check how Github allows for anyone to freely join the github repository without intervention from admin@the-blockchain-academy.com).

Members collaborating on this DAO are invited to familiarize themselves with Github through the availabel online sources and form their idea how to use it within the context of a collaborative decentralised and collective management of a DAO. For the very first instructions on how to use Github, the beginner's guide here is a good start: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

Looking forward to get this DAO experiment going on a collectively managed DAO basis.
